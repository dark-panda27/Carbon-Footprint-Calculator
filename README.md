# Carbon Footprint Tracker

This is a C# web application developed to calculate and track carbon footprint for organizations.

## Welcome Page

The Welcome Page introduces the purpose of the Carbon Footprint Tracker application. It includes a header, brief description of what carbon footprint is, and a button/link to navigate to the Login Page.

## Login Page

The Login Page allows users to authenticate and access the application. It includes input fields for username and password, along with a login button. Additionally, a navigation bar is provided for easy navigation back to the Welcome Page.
## Technologies Used

- C#
- ASP.NET Web Forms
- Bootstrap
NB. Bootstrap was used for styling the Welcome Page and Login Page. Due to the current situation and we started doing the project late, Bootstrap was chosen to quickly implement responsive design and improve the overall appearance of the pages. Please note that this is just an initial implementation, and we plan to further refine the design and layout in the upcoming steps of the project.
